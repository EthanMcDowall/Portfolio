            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Maidstone Borough Council is a Local Government Authority in the South East of England.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Screenshot of the previous design</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The website gets between four to seven million visits a year and saw a redesign in early 2018. However, since it went live there has been no user research to check whether the designs still meet user needs and didn’t meet accessibility standards. This led to this project. A new project was launched to improve the way a user interacts with the website, meets more user needs from a wider range of internal and external users whilst making it WCAG 2.1 AA accessible by 23rd September 2020.</p>
            <p>This project is live and can be viewed on <a href="https://maidstone.gov.uk">the website</a>.</p>
            <h2>Team make up</h2>
            <p>The team was made up of a Product Owner, Interaction Designer, Content Designer, User Researcher and a Developer.</p>
            <h2>My role</h2>
            <p>I had a hybrid role in this project. I was the lead designer and developer from initial concept through to final delivery. I was also the accessibility lead for the project. I was also responsible for mentoring a junior member of the team, making sure they were getting practical and real world experience of being a designer in large, high profile projects whilst ensuring they were getting the skills needed to develop their career.
            </p>
            <p>The project was run using Agile methodologies. A backlog was developed based on user needs and work was split into sprints lasting two weeks.
            </p>
            <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
            <p>I was responsible for creating low and high fidelity wireframes and prototypes based on user needs. I looked at solving problems that user needs raised by creating low fidelity prototypes using pen and paper to test my hypothesis. This meant involving members of the team to test my hypothesis and designs against these user needs.</p>
            <p>I then created various high fidelity prototypes to expand on these designs. I used Adobe XD to create them. These prototypes included creating page templates like the <a href="https://www.maidstone.gov.uk">home page</a> and <a href="https://www.maidstone.gov.uk/home/primary-services/bins-and-recycling/primary-areas/bulky-collections">content pages</a> to designing specific elements that a user will interact with, like cards, links and buttons and their different states.

            </figure>
            <p>I also created some of these prototypes in code as proof of concept to stakeholders</p>
            <h3>Developer</h3>
            <p>Once the designs were signed off at each iteration, I was then responsible for developing them into code using HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>After I had developed a component or template I tested them to make sure they met WCAG 2.1 AA standards. 
            </p>
            <h2>User research and user needs</h2>
            <p>The previous redesign focused on external users and their needs. However, user research uncovered new user needs from a wider range of internal users too. </p>
            <p>We’ve gathered research through web page feedback, statistics from Google Analytics, heat maps from software like Hotjar, in person observations and user testing. </p>
            <h3>Examples of user needs for the user</h3>
            <blockquote>As a user, I won't use a search, as the words I use won't be used by the Council.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>As a user, I'll use an A to Z as a last resort, as content should be easy to find.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>As a user, I want to click anywhere in a box, so that I don't have to figure out where to click.</blockquote>
            <h3>Examples of user needs for the organisation</h3>
            <blockquote>As Councillor,  I want our website to be visually appealing, so that I'm happy to refer my constituants to it.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>As a Councillor, I want images of Maidstone so that it's clear what website a user is on.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>As a member of staff, I want to be able to promote our services or events so that more people attend.</blockquote>
            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>The new design needs to be WCAG 2.1 compliant. There were a serveral issues I had to tackle.</p>
            <h4>Colour contrasts</h4>
            <p>The colour palette used had combinations that didn't have a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or higher.</p>
            <p>I created a colour palette that became AAA compliant. This colour palette allows the team to use colour combinations that meet contrast ratios that fit within our corporate branding.</p>
            <p>Pink had been used as the hover colour for links across the site. It was also being used as the focus state for buttons. This had a contrast ratio of 4.31:1 giving it a AA rating for contrast with a white background.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Pink had been used as the hover colour for links across the site. It was also being used as the focus state for buttons. I removed pink from the colour palette and added more colours from our branding. and replaced it with a dark green and dark purple.</p>
            <p>I also added two more darker background colours in blue and purple to give a bit more colour to the designs. When a user hovered over an interactive element that used the blue, green or purple, I created a darker shade to help signify the change in state. These colours were all AAA rated.</p>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Colour palette.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of a proposed colour palette.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4>Heading structures</h4>
            <p>I worked with our content designer to audit the website content. One of the main themes that can back from this was the incorrect use of headings.</p>
            <p>H2 headings were rarely used as almost every content page skipped from a H1 to a H3. This will cause issues for screen readers. This was down to having a non-styled H2 so it was never used. </p>
            <p>I completely revamped the design of the headings. Taking GDS and the NHS as inspiration, every header got a larger font size, larger line height, heavier font weight and greater spacing.</p>
            <h3>Designs</h3>
            <p>There were several components that conflicted with each other as well as some interactive elements having inconsistent designs leading to a confusing experience for users.</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <p>Links had inconsistent hover and focus states across the website which confused some users. Previously, links had a default state of dark blue that turned pink when hovered over. However, there was no focus state.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Old Links.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of old link states.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>To overcome this, I defined every link to be dark blue instead of the grey used for the main body copy. They were also bold and underlined. When a user hovered on the link it would remove the underline and change colour to a dark grey. The focus state was heavily inspired by GDS's link focus state.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Links.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of new link states.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The rationale behind this design was make sure colour blind users can still detect a change in state if the can't see the colour change as well as making it easier for users with poor site to notice the change in state with the underline being removed on hover whilst having a unique focus state so that another change of state is easier to notice.</p>
            <h4>Cards</h4>
            <p>The previous design had links sitting inside a grey card. When a user hovered over the link within the card the became underlined and the background colour remained the same. There was no focus state.<p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Old cards.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of the old card designs.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This led users to try and click or tap anywhere inside the box hoping that something would happen when they actually needed to click or tap on the link itself.</p>
            <p>My approach to this problem was to allow a user to click anywhere inside the box. Giving each box a focus state made sure that a user knew they selected that box. I also added a unique hover where the background colour turns to a darker grey, the bottom border colour turns to a dark version and the main heading loses its under. I also gave the card focus state to remain accessible so that users know that they’re interacting with the card.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Cards.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of the new card designs.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I used Hotjar to see how users were interacting with these cards. Whilst users were still clicking or touching the title within the card, there were also contacts in other areas of the box.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Hotjar touch points.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Hotjar shows where users are touching or clicking on your web page.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This validates my approach to making the entire box clickable, especially when it comes to mobile and tablet devices.</p> 
            <p>Different variations of these cards can be found across <a href="https://maidstone.gov.uk">maidstone.gov.uk</a>.
            <h4>Promoting services or events</h4>
            <p>Our senior leadership team wanted a way of promoting our services or events that happen throughout the year on the website. An example of a service that needs promoting includes new consultations and news items.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Promotion section (1).png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of my design concepts.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After a few iterations of the designs, I created ‘The latest in Maidstone’ section. This section solved a few user needs. Councillors wanted more imagery across the site and wanted the website to be visually appealing and our Senior Leadership needed a way of promoting services.</p>
            <p>The live design can be viewed on the <a href="https://maidstone.gov.uk" target="_blank">home page</a>.            </p>
            <p>This design was inspired by the cards I mentioned above. I wanted to keep the design as clean and simple as possible so that it is in keeping with the rest of the home page.</p>
            <p>From a development point of view, I made sure our content designer can easily take down and replace a card with new content if there is something new to promote.
            </p>
            <p>The new A to Z link can be viewed across <a href="https://maidstone.gov.uk" target="_blank">the website</a>.</p>
            <h2>What happens next?</h2>
            <p>We’re learning from the previous design by making sure more user research is planned to make the website continually meet user needs.</p>
            <p>I’m leading on the development of our design system for our website and forms to enable new members of the team to create usable, responsive and accessible products. It will also be publicly available for other organisations to use and contribute to.</p>

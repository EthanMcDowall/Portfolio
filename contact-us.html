        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We published a contact us form three years ago. This form was located at the top right hand corner of the header. Once a user completed this form it sent an email to our customer services email inbox who would then have to manually index that email within our document management system. This was intended as a quick fix that would be iterated over time. However, due to other projects and resources available this never happened.</p>
        <p>This project looked at the end to end journey from a user finding the form on the website through to our customer services team being able to respond to the user.</p>

        <h2>Team make up</h2>
        <p>The team was made up of an interaction designer, service designer and a developer. The service designer also took on content design and user research roles.
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was the interaction designer and developer for this project.</p>
        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for creating initial concepts, making low fidelity wireframes and prototypes through to high fidelity prototypes, iterating them based on research and feedback.</p>
        <h3>Developer</h3>
        <p>Once the project moved into a development phase, I became the main developer building the prototypes from a website point of view. Another colleague tackled development of the form for users to complete through our forms package. I used HTML, SASS and Javascript to create the section. </p>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>A lot of the Customer Services team management teams time was taken up by the current process. Once the form had emailed the email inbox, they manually indexed that email into our document management system - this took anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on the day of the week. They would then allocate those emails to the customer services team to deal with. This would usually mean that a user submitting the form would have to wait a minimum of two days for a response due to the level of manual tasks involved.</p>
        <p>On top of the time taken just to get to this point it was also clear from user research that they were getting more transactional requests for reporting missed bins or reporting fly tipping rather than users who need to contact us about their benefits claim or council tax bill for example. Just over 50% of the contact us forms completed were for transactional requests.</p>

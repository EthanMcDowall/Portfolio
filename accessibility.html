        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>September 23rd 2020 sees the introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1).  They’re a set of internationally recognised recommendations to improve accessibility across websites and apps. Maidstone Borough Council is a Local Government authority and our websites are covered by these guidelines.</p>
        <h2>Team make up</h2>
          <p>The team is made up of an interaction designer, content designer and two developers.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>I’m leading a small delivery team on this project. However, I’m also the interaction designer and I shared development work. Part of this role involved facilitating workshops with the team and other teams in the organisation with microsites to promote accessibility, our obligations while delivering training. </p>
        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
          <p>I’m responsible for any design work within this project. A lot of the design work was covered within the website redesign project as both projects were being worked on at the same time. </p>
        <h3>Developer</h3>
          <p>I shared development work with another developer due to the resources available.</p>
        <h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
          <p>This is a very complicated project. Some of the issues included lack of knowledge, skills, tools, time, resources and budget to deliver the end goal of making our sites compliant by 23rd September.</p>
          <p>A lack of knowledge within the team quickly became an issue. None of the team are experts so we all had a deep learning curve - however, Silktide greatly improved our knowledge. I personally spent a lot of time prior to the start of the project attempting to understand the guidelines and what they meant for our team. To combat this, I led and facilitated workshops with the delivery team to deepen their understanding of the regulations and to find areas to improve our technical and non-technical skills.</p>
          <p>Our budget was a major issue. In short, there was no budget. I worked with my manager to gain enough funds to get an audit of our main website. After further discussions, the decision was made to spend the money on a system that can provide a high level of automated testing for one year and to then raise more funds in the new financial year for an audit or for specialised user testing. We purchased a product called Silktide.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>One of the first things we did was to develop our <a href="https://www.maidstone.gov.uk/home/accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</a>. This was published back in September 2019 and has been updated several times since. </p>
          <p>Using Silktide reports, I divided the report into a series of tasks. These tasks became our sprints. I allocated these tasks based on the skill sets of the team. Content and non-technical work went to the content designer. Design work was allocated to me. Technical code work was allocated to the developer. I also took on some of this work to share the workload.
          </p>
          <p>I worked with the content designer to audit the website content. A common theme that appeared was the incorrect use of headings. I also created a new colour palette for the website that ensured colour contrasts that met AA and AAA standards. More information can be found on the <a href="https://ethanmcdowall.github.io/portfolio/maidstone-councils-website">website redesign project</a>.</p>
          <p>In one of the sprints I worked with the other developer on the team to look at how our components of our site failed to meet the guidelines. For example, the search had several issues. It couldn’t be navigated using a keyboard and the code used to make the search was poorly constructed HTML which caused issues with screen readers. Working together we refactored the HTML to work with screen readers - this was tested with Narrator on Windows, NVDA and Voiceover on IOS. We also wrote a few lines of Javascript that enabled a user to operate the search with their keyboard. </p>
          <p>Within the first three sprints I led the team to become the first Local Authority to receive a 100% WCAG 2.1 AAA complaint score according to the Silktide Index (in association with SOCITM). Since then we’ve remained in first place despite daily updates to the website. </p>

          </figure>
          <p>Despite this amazing result, it only covers automated testing. There’s still a lot more work to be done with manual testing with real users.</p>
          <h3>Workshops</h3>
          <p>As well as leading workshops within the delivery team, I led and facilitated workshops with other departments in the organisation.</p>

          </figure>          
          <p>These workshops took place virtually during lockdown. Our Communications team and Planning Policy team each have a website that they edit. They attended two different workshops which explained the regulations, how it affects them, what they need to do whilst committing to a plan of action for the coming months. Managers and senior members of the team attended to make sure we had their support for any additional work or changes to their work that would happen as a result of these workshops. I’ve facilitated two smaller workshops with the Communications team to discuss colour contrasts in the PDF documents that they create for other teams and how we can work together to actively discuss the impact these regulations have on our organisation with the rest of the organisation</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>September 23rd 2020 saw the introduction of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1).  They’re an set of guidelines to improve accessibility across websites and apps.These regulation became mandatory for the public sector to meet.</p>
        <p>A project was created to ensure our digital estate was accessible by the September 2020 deadline. A large portion of this work co-insided with the redesign of their website.</p>
        <h2>Team make up</h2>
        <p>The team was made up of two designers and two developers.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I had a few roles within this project. I led a small delivery team on this project. I was also the interaction designer and I shared development work.</p>
        <p>This role involved a lot of technical skill but it also involved a lot of stakeholder management. The Chief Executive, Directors and the Leader of the Council were all keen to have an accessibile digital estate. I had to set their expectations as this project was not only ambitious but it could have servere consequences if it went wrong. I set up monthly catch ups with the stakeholders to update them on the progress and issues. These sessions allowed me to ask for their support when issues such as departments buy in.</p>
        <p>I facilitated workshops with the team to develop their understanding of accessibility and how it applies to their roles. I also led workshops with other departments in the organisation to promote accessibility, explain what it is and how it affects them.</p>
        <p>I also mentored and trained a junior designer/developer in this project.</p>
                  <h3>Workshops</h3>
          <p>As well as leading workshops within the delivery team, I led and facilitated workshops with other departments in the organisation.</p>        
          <p>These workshops took place virtually during lockdown. Our Communications team and Planning Policy team each have a website that they edit. They attended two different workshops which explained the regulations, how it affects them, what they need to do whilst committing to a plan of action for the coming months. Managers and senior members of the team attended to make sure we had their support for any additional work or changes to their work that would happen as a result of these workshops. I’ve facilitated two smaller workshops with the Communications team to discuss colour contrasts in the PDF documents that they create for other teams and how we can work together to actively discuss the impact these regulations have on our organisation with the rest of the organisation</p>
        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for any design work within this project. A lot of the design work was covered within the website redesign project as both projects were being worked on at the same time. </p>
        <h3>Developer</h3>
        <p>I shared development work with another developer due to the resources available.</p>
        <h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
          <p>This is a very complicated project that covers many departments, third party suppliers and the public. Some of the issues ranged from:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>lack of knowledge</li>
              <li>time</li>
              <li>resource</li>
              <li>budget</li>
              <li>the organisation and third party tools, systems and portals</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>1. Lack of knowledge, skills and resource</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>There was a clear lack of knowledge within the team - none of us had worked with these guidelines before. There was also a lack of understanding or ownership from the rest of the organisation and they had no grasp of the penalties involved should we do nothing.</p>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>I personally spent a lot of time before the start of the project attempting to understand the guidelines and how they apply to the work our team did. I led and facilitated workshops with the delivery team to deepen their understanding of the regulations and to find areas to improve our technical and non-technical skills.</p>
          <p>I raised awareness across our organisation in a few ways. Firstly, our internal communications team ran frequent news articles on the subject. I also worked with our senior management to hand responsibility of inaccessible content back to the department - putting ownership on them to rectify it. 
          <h3>2. Time</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <h3>3. Budget</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>Our budget was a major issue. In short, there was very limited budget - not enough to do rounds of paid user research to test any changes we made.</p>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          I worked with my manager to gain enough funds from our Finance Director to get an audit of our main website. After further discussions, the decision was made to spend the money on a system that can provide a high level of automated testing for one year and to then raise more funds in the new financial year for an audit or for specialised user testing. We purchased a product called Silktide in partnership with Tunbridge Wells Borough Council.</p>
          <h3>4. The organisation and third party tools, systems and portals</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>Using Silktide reports, I divided the report into a series of tasks. These tasks became tickets within our sprints. I allocated these tasks based on the skill sets of the team. Content and non-technical work went to the Content Designer. I dealt with design work and shared developer tasks. </p>
          <p>I worked with the Content Designer to audit the website content. A common theme that appeared was the incorrect use of headings. we assessed the website to create our Accessibility Statement. This was published back in September 2019 and gets updated been updated several times since.</p>
          <p>A new colour palette was created to ensure colour contrasts that met AA and AAA standards. More information can be found on the <a href="https://ethanmcdowall.github.io/portfolio/maidstone-councils-website">website redesign project</a>.</p>
          <p>I worked with the other developer to look at how the components of our site failed to meet the guidelines. For example, the search bar had several issues. It couldn’t be navigated using a keyboard as it used poorly constructed HTML and SCSS. This caused issues with keyboard users and screen readers. Working together we refactored the HTML to work with screen readers - this was tested with Narrator on Windows, NVDA, and Voiceover on IOS. We also wrote a few lines of Javascript that enabled a user to operate the search with their keyboard.</p>
          <p>Within the first four sprints, I led the team to become the first Local Authority to receive a 100% WCAG 2.1 AAA complaint score according to the Silktide Index (in association with SOCITM). Since then we’ve remained in first place despite daily updates to the website.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Despite this amazing result, it only covers automated testing. There’s still a lot more work to be done with manual testing with real users.</p>
          <h2>What happens next</h2>
          <p>There are several next steps, however, the next phase in this project will involve co-designing a process with our Communications team to create accessible PDF’s. They get weekly requests to make PDF’s for documents so creating this process will ensure accessibility is at the heart of the document rather than being an afterthought.</p>

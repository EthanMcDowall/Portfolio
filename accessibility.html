        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>September 23rd 2020 saw the introduction of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1).  They’re an set of guidelines to improve accessibility across websites and apps.These regulation became mandatory for the public sector to meet.</p>
        <p>A project was created to ensure our digital estate was accessible by the September 2020 deadline. A large portion of this work co-insided with the redesign of their website.</p>
        <h2>Team make up</h2>
        <p>The team was made up of two designers and two developers.</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I had a few roles within this project. I led a small delivery team on this project. I was also the interaction designer and I shared development work.</p>
        <p>This role involved a lot of technical skill but it also involved a lot of stakeholder management. The Chief Executive, Directors and the Leader of the Council were all keen to have an accessibile digital estate. I had to set their expectations as this project was not only ambitious but it could have servere consequences if it went wrong. I set up monthly catch ups with the stakeholders to update them on the progress and issues. These sessions allowed me to ask for their support when issues such as departments buy in.</p>
        <p>I also mentored and trained a junior designer/developer in this project.</p>
        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
        <p>I was responsible for any design work within this project. A lot of the design work was covered within the website redesign project as both projects were being worked on at the same time. </p>
        <h3>Developer</h3>
        <p>I shared development work with another developer due to the resources available.</p>
        <h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
        <h3>1. Lack of knowledge</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>There was a clear lack of knowledge within the team - none of us had worked with these guidelines before.</p>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>I led workshops for the delivery team to build their knowledge on accessibility. They covered a range of topics including code and content improvements.</p>
          <p>I developed a framework to embed into our projects to maintain high accessibility standards. This included putting the product through Silktide, testing it with screen reader software such as Voiceover. These workshops also covered how the regulations will change our day-to-day work and how they will be baked into the way we run our projects</p>
        <h3>2. Time</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
        <h3>3. Budget</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>In short, there was no budget at the beginning of this project.</p>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>I worked with my manager to raise a business case to gain a small budget from our Finance Director to pay for an audit of our main website. After further discussions, I suggested we use the budget on a system that can provide a high level of automated testing for one year then negotiate for more funds in the new financial year for an auditor or specialised user testing. We purchased a product called Silktide in partnership with Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. </p>
        <h3>4. The organisation</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>The organisation did not understand what WCAG 2.1 meant, how it was relevant to us, and the punishments for not being compliant. There was no buy-in from senior members to allocate resources to become compliant.</p>
          <p>The website is made up of several content management systems, third-party tools, and portals, and after some testing, their systems discovered that none of them were compliant. We can directly affect the main website, however,  we cannot change any third-party system or portal without dealing with business stakeholders. </p>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>I led and facilitated workshops with other departments in the organisation which took place virtually during the lockdown. </p>        
          <p>Our Communications team and Planning Policy team each have a website that they edit. They attended two different workshops which explained the regulations, how it affects them, what they need to do whilst committing to a plan of action for the coming months. Managers and senior members of the team attended to make sure we had their support for any additional work or changes to their work that would happen as a result of these workshops. I’ve facilitated two smaller workshops with the Communications team to discuss colour contrasts in the PDF documents that they create for other teams and how we can work together to actively discuss the impact these regulations have on our organisation with the rest of the organisation.</p>
        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
          <h3>Third party tools, systems and portals</h3>
          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <h4>Actions and results</h4>
          <p>Using Silktide reports, I divided the report into a series of tasks. These tasks became tickets within our sprints. I allocated these tasks based on the skill sets of the team. Content and non-technical work went to the Content Designer. I dealt with design work and shared developer tasks. </p>
          <p>I worked with the Content Designer to audit the website content. A common theme that appeared was the incorrect use of headings. we assessed the website to create our Accessibility Statement. This was published back in September 2019 and gets updated been updated several times since.</p>
          <p>A new colour palette was created to ensure colour contrasts that met AA and AAA standards. More information can be found on the <a href="https://ethanmcdowall.github.io/portfolio/maidstone-councils-website">website redesign project</a>.</p>
          <p>I worked with the other developer to look at how the components of our site failed to meet the guidelines. For example, the search bar had several issues. It couldn’t be navigated using a keyboard as it used poorly constructed HTML and SCSS. This caused issues with keyboard users and screen readers. Working together we refactored the HTML to work with screen readers - this was tested with Narrator on Windows, NVDA, and Voiceover on IOS. We also wrote a few lines of Javascript that enabled a user to operate the search with their keyboard.</p>
          <p>Within the first four sprints, I led the team to become the first Local Authority to receive a 100% WCAG 2.1 AAA complaint score according to the Silktide Index (in association with SOCITM). Since then we’ve remained in first place despite daily updates to the website.</p>

              <figcaption>An image displaying our 100% score in the Silktide Index.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Despite this amazing result, it only covers automated testing. There’s still a lot more work to be done with manual testing with real users.</p>
          <h2>What happens next</h2>
          <p>There are several next steps, however, the next phase in this project will involve co-designing a process with our Communications team to create accessible PDF’s. They get weekly requests to make PDF’s for documents so creating this process will ensure accessibility is at the heart of the document rather than being an afterthought.</p>
